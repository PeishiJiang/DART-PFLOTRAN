This is where DART-PFLOTRAN integration happens for a specific application. The structure of this repository are as follows:

- dart_inout:
  It contains the DART observation data, DART input files (prior data in netCDF) and DART output files (posterior data in netCDF).

- obs_type:
  It contains the mapping between PFLOTRAN variable names and DART generic variable names used in this application

- pflotran_input:
  It contains the PFLOTRAN's input files (e.g., PFLOTRAN.in, parameter_prior.h5, and other input data)

- pflotran_output:
  It contains the PFLOTRAN's output files (i.e., the HDF5 output files for each ensemble/realization)

- work:
  It contains DART executable files, input namelist, and other temporary files generated by DART during assimilation
