    "# Overview\n",
    "The **objective** of this notebook is to present the workflow of conducting data assimilation on [PFLOTRAN](https://www.pflotran.org/) by using [DART](https://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/). Briefly, the procedures are as follows:\n",
    "1. [x] [Configuration](#parameter): define directories, file locations, and other parameters\n",
    "- [x] [PFLOTRAN preparation](#pflotran_prepare): generate PFLOTRAN input files\n",
    "- [x] [PFLOTRAN model spin-up](#pflotran_spinup): conduct model spin-up\n",
    "- [x] [DART files preparation](#dart_prepare): add new DART quantities, prepare DART input namelists, prepare DART prior data, prepare observations in DART format, and check ```model_mod``` interface\n",
    "- [x] [Generate all the executable files](#dart_executables): generate all the executables, convert observations in DART format, check ```model_mod``` interface, and test the filter\n",
    "- [x] [Run DART and PFLOTRAN](#run_dart_pflotran): run the shell script for integrating DART filter and PFLOTRAN model\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we perform inverse modeling on a 1D thermal model for illustration. The model assimilates temperature observation to update its parameters (i.e., flow flux, porosity, and thermal conductivity). For now, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used for assimilation."
